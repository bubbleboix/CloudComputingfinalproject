Final project for cloud

in theory the script does not need a local server at all , power BI allows u to pull files from microsoft one drive.... 
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-onedrive/15.10.5
unable to perform the commands due to the code doest not work for python 3 or access error. 

The script pulls the csv file directly from the website and cleans it then saves the file on your computer ,
but able to send it to ur one drive to be fully cloud enabled 

GetUsers- you can invite an unlimited number of users to work on the same database and do edits with your premissions
Given the professors acces to my data sheet and my group memeber as well, Power BI/manage content

Functional requirements of data analysis

- the system shall provide the ability to drill down across and slice and dice.
Power BI allows u to do all the above function as demonstrated in my shared data sheet, you can specfic
the attributes that u want to investiage and i put a slice functions on the same for people with no data analyse knowledge
-able to demonsrate the measurement and provide graphical representation
Done graph shown is able to demonstrate the rs between attributes and death
-Able to read sources from mutiple cells 
yes Power BI has a range of common data format but the only restriction is the database from the cloud can only be Azure 

Non functional requirements

User friendly - above cloud solution requirements no prior knowledge of coding and data understanding and is fairly easy to pick up by
users with no experience 

Ease of sharing- Sharing is as simple as giving access rights to a person email, no need to send a file or give a specfic access like non cloud 
solution

Ease of understanding code - Data cleaning is perharps the only diffcult part of analyse , using the code i provide a user is able to pull 
and modify changes to fix their demands and needs 

Sercuity- Power BI provides double layer sercuity as it is linked to ur microsoft and u are able to get notifications if some one access ur account 
illegally on your phone.

On the go - Power BI has a moblie phone apps to enable fast and on the go analyses 

Handling mass amount of data- the file was 20k cells long , easily would have hanged excel.

Effective cloud base solutions:

all the functional and non functions requirements was filled using power BI , however data cleaning was the only services that power BI did not preform
and writing a script to push the file to ur one driver is a full cloud base solution , without needing to do any offline trouble shooting
